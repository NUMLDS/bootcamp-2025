# Introduction

## Why R?

> -   R is open source
> -   R has many statistical capabilities
> -   R can create custom data visualizations
> -   R has a large community of users

## What is RStudio?

> -   RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R
> -   RStudio provides a user-friendly interface for coding
> -   RStudio Desktop is the most commonly used version of the software
> -   Posit (formerly known as RStudio) is the company that devloped and maintains RStudio

## Exploring the IDE

![](figures/rstudio_screenshot.PNG)

<aside class="notes">

RStudio helps you organize your workflow and keep track of your work. The top-left pane is where you open, work on, and save script files. The bottom-left pane includes the console, which is where your code actually "runs". The right-hand side panes include tools for manging your environment, workspace, and packages; for plotting and graphics; for accessing help files; and more.

## Some key concepts

You will hear these terms often this week:

> -   Objects
> -   Variables
> -   Data Frames
> -   Functions
> -   Packages

## Starting with the basics

> -   Arithmetic with R
> -   Objects and variable assignment
> -   Data types, incl.: character, numeric, logical, factors
> -   Data structures, incl.: vectors, matricies, data frames, lists

<aside class="notes">

The above topics are the basics you need to learn before we start working with "real" data.

</aside>

## Our materials

All of our materials are available at [github.com/NUMLDS/bootcamp-2025](https://www.github.com/NUMLDS/bootcamp-2025). Today, you will only need to work with two files, which are in the ZIP file linked at the top of the Github page.

Starting with the R3 session later this week, you will be working with a much wider set of files. You will also learn how to make a copy of the whole bootcamp-2025 repository using Git.

# Basics and data types

## Arithmetic

At its most basic level, you can use R as a calculator. The basic operators are all what you would expect for addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and exponentiation (`^`). You can use parentheses to indicate which operation should take place first.

You can save numbers or the results of operations as *objects* (whose names must start with a character) using the assignment operator `<-` or a single equal sign `=`. We sometimes call these objects *variables*. Look in the **Environment** to see what objects currently exist.

```{r}
x <- 11*5
x
```

## Arithmetic: exercise

Open up the file `R1-R2_exercises.R` in RStudio. <br> Do the following tasks:

-   Pick a number; save it as `x`
-   Multiply x by 3
-   Take the log of the above
-   Subtract 4 from the above
-   Square the above

## Arithmetic: exercise

```{r arithmetic}
x <- 5
x*3
log(x*3)
(log(x*3))-4
((log(x*3))-4)^2
```

## Functions

Functions are called with `functionName(parameters)`. Multiple paramters are *comma-separated*. Paramters can be named. For unnamed parameters, the order matters. R functions don't change the objects passed to them (more on this later).

Let's take a look at a simple function, `log()`, which takes the log of a number. You can access its help file by entering `?log` in the console. Do so now. What does the function do? What are the arguments?

## Functions

```{r}
# Take the natural log of 10
log(10)

# Take the log of 10 with base-2
log(10, base=2)

# Store the result of log(10) as a variable
y <- log(10)
```

## Data types

> -   **numeric**: real or decimal
>
>     -   **integer**: a specific type; most numbers are numeric instead
>
>     -   **complex**: ex: `2+5i`
>
> -   **character**: `"text data"`, denoted with quotes <br><small>(`'single quotes'` and `"double quotes"` both work)</small>
>
> -   **logical**: `TRUE` or `FALSE` <br><small>(When coerced into numeric type, `TRUE`=`1` and `FALSE`=`0`)</small>
>
> -   Use `class()` on an object to check its type

## Data types

```{r}
x <- "some text"
x
class(x)

x <- 5
x
class(x)
```

## Logical Operators

The basic logical operators in R are:

-   `==` for "is equal"; `!` for "is not"

-   `&` for "and"; `|` for "or"

-   `<` for "lesser than"; `>` for "more than"

A statement with logical operators will return a logical object `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

## Logical Operators

```{r}
5 > 4

(5 > 4) & (4 < 5)

(5 > 4) | (4 < 5)

!(4 > 5)
```

## Logical Operators: exercise

-   Check if 1 is bigger than 2
-   Check if 1 + 1 is equal to 2
-   Check if it is true that the strings "eat" and "drink" are not equal to each other
-   Check if it is true that 1 is equal to 1 *AND* 1 is equal to 2 <br><small>(Hint: remember what the operators `&` and `|` do)</small>
-   Check if it is true that 1 is equal to 1 *OR* 1 is equal to 2

## Logical Operators: exercise

```{r comparisons}
1 > 2
(1 + 1) == 2
"eat" != 'drink'
(1==1) & (1==2)
(1==1) | (1==2)
```

## Packages

-   Install the package `ggplot2`<br><small>(You only need to do this the first time)</small>
-   Load the package `ggplot2`
-   Open the help file for the dataset `mpg`
<br></br>
-   **Homework**: Install and load the package `tidyverse` and open the help file for the function `recode`

## Packages

```{r packages, eval=F}
install.packages("ggplot2")

library(ggplot2)

?mpg
```

# Data structures

## Vectors

> -   Vectors store multiple values of a **single** data type (i.e. vectors are *homogeneous*)
>
> -   Create a vector using the `c()` function
>
> -   Arithmetic operators and many functions can apply to vectors (i.e. some functions are *vectorized*)
>
> -   Vectors can be *indexed* by:
>
>     -   element position (`vec[1]`)
>     -   'slice' position (`vec[1:3]`)
>     -   condition (`vec[vec>2]`).

## Vectors

```{r}
vec <- c("yes", "no", "maybe")
vec <- c(1, 2, 3)

vec[1]
vec[vec<3]

vec*2
log(vec)
```

## Vectors: exercise

Return to the exercise file and complete the following tasks:

-   Run the code to generate variables `x1` and `x2`
-   Select the 3rd element in `x1`
-   Select the elements of x1 that are less than 0
-   Select the elements of x2 that are greater than 1
-   Create x3 containing the first five elements of x2
-   Select all but the third element of x1

## Vectors: exercise

```{r vectors}
set.seed(1234) 
x1 <- rnorm(5)
x2 <- rnorm(20, mean=0.5)
x1[3]
x1[x1 < 0]
x2[x2 > 1]
x3 <- x2[1:5]
x1[-3]
```

## Interlude: Missing Values

Real-world data often include missing values. In R, missing values are stored as `NA`. Vectors containing any data type can contain missing values. Functions deal with missing values differently, and sometimes require arguments to specify how to deal with missing values.

```{r missing values}
vec <- c(1, 8, NA, 7, 3)
mean(vec)
mean(vec, na.rm=TRUE)
```

<aside class="notes">

Ask students to calculate the mean in their exercises script.

</aside>

## Interlude: Missing Values

You can check if a vector contains missing values by the function `is.na()`. Since this returns a logical vector, you can use `sum()` or `mean()` on the result to count the number or proportion of `TRUE` values.

```{r missing values 2}
is.na(vec)
sum(is.na(vec))
mean(is.na(vec))
```

<aside class="notes">

Ask students to calculate the number of mean values in their exercises script.

</aside>

## Factors

> -   Factors are a special type of vector that are useful for categorical variables
> -   Factors have a limited number of *levels* that the variable can take, set by the user
> -   For categorical variables with natural ordering between categories, we often want to use *ordered factors*
> -   Create factors with `factor()`, which includes an argument for `levels =`

## Factors

```{r factors}
fac <- factor(c("red", "yellow", "green", "green","green"))

class(fac)
levels(fac)
```

<aside class="notes">

We won't spend any more time reviewing factors today. If you need a refresher, check the lecture notes.

</aside>

## Lists

> -   Lists are like vectors, but more complex.
> -   Lists are *heterogenous*: they can store single elements, vectors, or even lists.
> -   You can keep multi-dimensional and ragged data in R using lists.
> -   You can index an element in a list using double brackets: `[[1]]`. Single brackets will return the element as a list.

## Lists

```{r lists}
my_list <- list(42, "Hello world!",  c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))

my_list[1]
class(my_list[1])

my_list[[1]]
class(my_list[[1]])
```

<aside class="notes">

For more on lists, see the lecture notes or data camp.

</aside>

## Matrices

> -   Matrices in R are two-dimensional arrays.
> -   Matrices are *homogeneous*: all values of a matrix must be of the same data type.
> -   You can initialize a matrix using the `matrix()` function.
> -   Matrices are used sparingly in R, primarily for numerical calculations or explicit matrix manipulation.
> -   Matrices are indexed as follows: `mat[row no, col no]`.

## Matrices

```{r matrices}
my_matrix <- matrix(data = 1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
my_matrix

my_matrix[1, 2]
```

<aside class="notes">

There is an example matrix for you to practice with in the exercises file, but we won't do it together.

</aside>

## Data frames

> -   Data frames are the core data structure in R. A data frame is a list of named vectors with the same length.
> -   Data frames are *heterogeneous*: the vectors in a data frames can each be of a different data type.
> -   Columns are typically variables and rows are observations.
> -   You can make make data frames with `data.frame()`, or by combining vectors with `cbind()` or `rbind()`.
> -   Data frames can be indexed in the same way as matrices: `df[row no, col no]`.
> -   Data frames can also be indexed by using variable/column names: `df$var` or `df[["var"]]`.

## Data frames: exercise

-   Load the example data frame using the code provided
-   Identify the number of observations (rows), number of variables (columns), and names of variables using `str()`
-   Select the variable `mpg`
-   Select the 4th row
-   Square the value of the `cyl` variable and store this as a new variable `cylsq`

## Data frames: exercise

```{r data frames setup, include = F}
data(mtcars)
```

```{r data frames 1}
str(mtcars)
```

```{r data frames 2, eval=F}
mtcars$mpg
```

```{r data frames 3}
mtcars[4,]
mtcars$cylsq <- (mtcars$cyl)^2
```

# Reading files

## Working directories

The working directory is the folder where R scripts and projects look for files by default.

You can go to the Files tab in the bottom right window in RStudio and find the directory you want. Then you can set it as a working directory with an option in the "More" menu. Or you can use the `setwd()` as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("/nfs/home/krn5889/R sessions")
```

## Reading files: read.csv()

```{r read.csv intro, eval=F}
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder5.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

```{r read.csv breakdown, eval=F}
gapminder <- read.csv(file = "data/gapminder5.csv",
                       sep = ",",
                       stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

<aside class="notes">

The above code is what you will usually see and use. The below code breaks down what is going on inside.

</aside>

## Reading files: exercise

-   Check your working directory with `getwd()`.
-   Import the `gapminder` data set using `read.csv()` and see what happens in the Environment tab.
-   Take a look at the data using `head()` and `View()`
<br></br>
After installing `tidyverse`:
-   Load the `readr` package
-   Use `read_csv()` to load the gapminder data. Read the message generated in the console.

## Reading files: exercise

```{r read_csv intro, eval=F}
getwd()
head(gapminder5)
View(gapminder5)
```

```{r read_csv tidyverse, message=TRUE}
library(readr)
gapminder <- read_csv("data/gapminder5.csv")
```

## Reading files

> -   You can read files using RStudio's interface through the "Files" tab
> -   You can also read files from the full local path or from URLs
> -   For other file types, use the packages `haven` (Stata, SAS, SPSS) or `readxl` (Excel)

# Roadmap

## Roadmap for the rest of the R sessions

-   Today we will learn how to do basic **data manipulation** and **data visualization** in base R

-   Most commonly, you will do these tasks using specialized packages such as `tidyverse` or `data.table`

-   So why teach these skills in base R?

    -   This helps you understand how R works
    -   Many packages rely on how these tasks work in base R
    -   Useful for simple tasks in workflows that otherwise don't involve much manipulation or visualization

# Data manipulation

## Exploring data frames

> -   You can view data frames in RStudio with `View()` and examine other characteristics with `str()`, `dim()`, `names()`, `nrow()`, and more.
>
> -   When run on a data frame, `summary()` returns summary statistics for all variables.
>
> -   `mean()`, `median()`, `var()`, `sd()`, and `quantile()` are useful functions for variables.
>
> -   Frequency tables are a simple and useful way to explore discrete/categorical variables in data frames
>
>     -   `table()` creates a frequency table of one or more variables
>     -   `prop.table()` can turn a frequency table into a proportion table

<aside class="notes">

Notice that any data frames which have been read in or created, like all other objects, can be seen in the environment

</aside>

## Exploring data frames: exercise

-   Run `summary()` on the gapminder data
-   Find the mean of the variable `pop`
-   Create a frequency table of the variable `year` using `table()`
-   Create a proportion table of the variable `continent` using `prop.table()` <br><small>(Hint: check the help file for `prop.table()` to see what the input should be)</small>

## Exploring data frames: exercise

```{r exploring data frames pt1}
summary(gapminder)
```

## Exploring data frames: exercise

```{r exploring data frames pt2}
mean(gapminder$pop)
table(gapminder$year)
prop.table(table(gapminder$continent))
```

## Subsetting

> -   One of the benefits of R is that we can work with multiple data frames at the same time
>
> -   We will often want to *subset* a data frame, i.e. work with a portion of the data frame
>
> -   There are two common ways to subset a data frame in base R
>
>     -   Index the data frame: `gapminder[gapminder$continent=="Asia",]` (note the use of a logical statement and the comma)
>     -   Use the `subset()` function: `subset(gapminder, subset=continent=="Asia")`

## Sorting

> -   The `sort()` function reorders elements, in ascending order by default.
>
>     -   You can flip the order by using the `decreasing = TRUE` argument.
>
> -   The `order()` function gives you the index positions in sorted order.
>
> -   `sort()` is useful for quickly viewing vectors; `order()` is useful for arranging data frames.

## Subsetting and Sorting: exercise

-   Create a new data frame called `gapminder07` containing only those rows in the gapminder data where `year` is 2007
-   Created a sorted frequency table of the variable `continent` in `gapminder07` <br><small>(Hint: use `table()` and `sort()`)</small>
-   Print out the population of Mexico in 2007
-   Try the bonus question if you have time

## Subsetting and Sorting: exercise

```{r subsetting and sorting}
gapminder07 <- subset(gapminder, subset = year==2007)
sort(table(gapminder07$continent))
gapminder07$pop[gapminder07$country=="Mexico"]
head(gapminder07[order(gapminder07$pop, decreasing=TRUE),])
```

<aside class="notes">

Don't worry too much about the bonus question if you find it confusing. The package `dplyr`, which we will cover on Thursday, will offer other ways to do this kind of task which some of you may find more intuitive.

</aside>

## Adding and removing columns

When cleaning or wrangling datasets in RStudio, we will often want to create new variables.

Two ways to add a vector as a new variable in R:

```{r adding columns, eval=F}
gapminder$newvar <- newvar

gapminder <- cbind(gapminder, newvar)
```

Removing columns is easy too:

```{r removing columns, eval=F}
gapminder$newvar <- NULL

gapminder <- gapminder[-"newvar"]
```

## Recoding variables

> -   A common task when cleaning/wrangling data is recoding variables.
>
> -   Think about what the recoded variable should look like & then decide on an approach.
>
>     -   Sometimes, a single function can accomplish the recoding task needed. The new vector can then be assigned to a new column in the data frame.
>     -   If no single function comes to mind, we can initialize a new variable in the data frame, and assign values using indexes and conditional statements.
>     -   More complex recoding tasks can be accomplished with other packages like `dplyr`, which you can preview in the lecture notes.

## Recoding variables: exercise

Use the data frame `gapminder07` throughout this exercise.

-   Round the values of the variable `lifeExp` using `round()`, and store this as a new variable `lifeExp_round`
-   Print out the new variable to see what it looks like
-   Read through the code that creates the new variable `lifeExp_over70` and try to understand what it does.
-   Try to create a new variable `lifeExp_highlow` that has the value "High" when life expectancy is over the mean and the value "Low" when it is below the mean.

## Recoding variables: exercise

```{r recoding variables}
gapminder07$lifeExp_round <- round(gapminder07$lifeExp)
head(gapminder07$lifeExp_round)
```

## Recoding variables: exercise

```{r}
gapminder07$lifeExp_over70 <- NA  # Initialize a variable containing all "NA" values
gapminder07$lifeExp_over70[gapminder07$lifeExp>70] <- "Yes"
gapminder07$lifeExp_over70[gapminder07$lifeExp<70] <- "No"
table(gapminder07$lifeExp_over70)
```

## Recoding variables: exercise

```{r}
gapminder07$lifeExp_highlow <- NA
gapminder07$lifeExp_highlow[gapminder07$lifeExp>mean(gapminder07$lifeExp)] <- "High"
gapminder07$lifeExp_highlow[gapminder07$lifeExp<mean(gapminder07$lifeExp)] <- "Low"
table(gapminder07$lifeExp_highlow)
```

## Aggregating

> -   Notice that the observations (i.e. rows) in our data frame are grouped; specifically, each country is grouped into a continent.
>
> -   We are often interested in summary statistics by groups.
>
> -   The `aggregate()` function accomplishes this: `aggregate(y ~ x, FUN = mean)` gives the mean of vector `y` for each unique group in `x`.
>
>     -   `mean` can be replaced by other functions here, such as `median`.
>
> -   **Try it**! In the exercise file, find the mean of life expectancy in 2007 for each continent.

## Aggregating: exercise

```{r aggregating pt 1}
aggregate(gapminder07$lifeExp ~ gapminder07$continent, FUN = mean)
```

```{r aggregating pt 2}
aggregate(lifeExp ~ continent, data = gapminder07, FUN = mean)
```

## Statistics

> -   Here are some easy statistical analyses to conduct in R
>
>     -   Correlations: `cor()`; Covariance: `cov()`
>     -   T-tests: `t.test(var1 ~ var2)`, where `var2` is the grouping variable
>     -   Linear regression: `lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = df)`
>
> -   You can store the results of these functions in objects, which is especially useful for statistical models with many components.

## Statistics: exercise

Use `gapminder07` for all the below exercises.

<small>You're using some new functions, so refer to help files whenever you get stuck.</small>

-   Calculate the correlation between `lifeExp` and `gdpPercap`.
-   Use a t-test to evaluate the difference in `gdpPercap` between "high" and "low" life expectancy countries. Store the results as `t1`, and then print out `t1`.

## Statistics: exercise

```{r statistics pt 1}
cor(gapminder07$lifeExp, gapminder07$gdpPercap)
t1 <- t.test(gapminder07$gdpPercap~gapminder07$lifeExp_highlow)
t1 <- t.test(gdpPercap~lifeExp_highlow, data=gapminder07)
t1
```

<small>Note that `t1` is stored as a list. You can now call up the components of the t-test when you need them.</small>

## Statistics: exercise

-   Conduct a linear regression using `lm()` which predicts `lifeExp` as a function of `gdpPercap` and `pop`. Store the results as `reg1`.

    -   You can define all the variables using the `df$var` syntax, or you can just use variable names and identify the data frame in the `data =` argument.
    -   Examples are shown at the bottom of the help file for `lm()`

-   Print out `reg1`.

-   Run `summary()` on `reg1`.

## Statistics: exercise

```{r statistics pt 2}
reg1 <- lm(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap + pop, data = gapminder07)
reg1
summary(reg1)
```

# Writing files

## Writing a data file

> -   We will often want to save the data frames as data files after cleaning/wrangling/etc.
>
> -   You can use `write.csv()` from base R or `write_csv()` from `readr` to do this.
>
> -   **Try it!** Save the data frame `gapminder07` in the same directory that `gapminder5.csv` is located.
>
>     -   If you use `write.csv()` , set the argument `row.names = FALSE`
>
>     -   If you use `write_csv()`, it does not include row names/numbers by default

## Writing a data file: exercise

```{r writing files, eval=F}
write.csv(gapminder07, file="data/gapminder07.csv", row.names=FALSE)
write_csv(gapminder07, file="data/gapminder07.csv")
```

## Save R objects

> -   You can save all objects in your workspace using `save.image()` or by clicking the "Save" icon in the Environment tab.
>
>     -   You can load all objects back in using `load.image()` or opening the `.RData` file that is created.
>     -   You can save specific objects in an `.RData` file with the `save()` function.
>
> -   If your script file is well-written, you should be able to retrieve all your objects just by running your code again.
>
> -   If you have a project with code that takes a long time to run, I would recommend using project files.

# Data visualization

## Base R vs. ggplot2

> -   We will only cover visualization briefly today, using some functions included in base R. Data scientists generally use other packages for data visualization, especially `ggplot2`, which we will cover next Monday.
>
> -   So why learn data visualization in base R?
>
>     -   Some of the simple functions are useful ways to explore data while doing analysis.
>     -   The syntax of visualization in base R is often adopted by other packages.

## Histograms

> -   Histograms are a useful way to examine the distribution of a single variable. The base R function for histograms is simple: `hist()`.
>
> -   **Try it!** Create a histogram of the variable `lifeExp` in `gapminder07`.
>
>     -   When you're done, look at the help file and try to re-create the histogram, this time with a title and axis labels.
>     -   Bonus: Change the `breaks =` argument from its default setting and see what happens.

## Histograms: exercise

```{r histograms}
hist(gapminder07$lifeExp, 
     main="Distribution of life expectancy across countries in 2007", 
     xlab="Life expectancy", ylab="Frequency")
```

## Scatterplots

> -   You can create a scatterplot by providing a formula containing two variables (i.e. `y ~ x`) to the `plot()` function in R.
> -   Titles and axis labels can be added in `plot()` similarly to `hist()`.
> -   The function `abline()` can "layer" straight lines on top of a `plot()` output.

## Scatterplots: exercise

-   Create a scatterplot with `lifeExp` on the y-axis and `gdpPercap` on the x-axis.
-   Add a title and axis labels.
-   Bonus: Add a horizontal line indicating the mean of `lifeExp` onto the plot using `abline()`.

## Scatterplots: exercise

```{r scatterplot 1}
plot(gapminder07$lifeExp ~ gapminder07$gdpPercap)
```

## Scatterplots: exercise

```{r scatterplot 2}
plot(gapminder07$lifeExp ~ gapminder07$gdpPercap,
     main="Relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita in 2007", 
     ylab="Life expectancy", xlab="GDP per capita")
```

## Scatterplots: exercise

```{r scatterplot 3}
plot(gapminder07$lifeExp ~ gapminder07$gdpPercap,
     main="Relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita in 2007", 
     ylab="Life expectancy", xlab="GDP per capita")
abline(h = mean(gapminder07$lifeExp))
```

# The End!
